# Welcome dear user! In this folder, you can find a profiler to create a 1D Consolidation – Porewater Pressure Profiles and Isochrones
## This module implements the classical Fourier-series solution for the 1D consolidation (Terzaghi) problem with double drainage and uniform initial excess porewater pressure
### This profiler has been made among a challenge expressed in the Geotechnics class of 9th of december, 2025

The folders provide:

- A function **`porewater_pressure(Z, T)`** to compute the non-dimensional
  porewater pressure W(Z,T).
- A plotting utility to generate profiles and isochrones.
- An example figure reproducing the typical consolidation isochrones
  seen in soil mechanics textbooks.
